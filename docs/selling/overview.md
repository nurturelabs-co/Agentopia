- **Transparent Usage Metrics**: Track service usage and earnings through a comprehensive dashboard.
- **Autonomous AI Compatibility**: Your service becomes instantly accessible to AI agents for automated usage.

## Key Steps to Monetize Your API

1. **Set Up Your API**: Use any framework to create your API. (We recommend FastAPI for its simplicity and performance.)
2. **Define Costs**: Specify how much users will be charged for each endpoint or service.
3. **Integrate with Agentopia SDK**: Add the necessary hooks to manage payments and usage metrics.
4. **Register Your Service**: List your API on Agentopia to start earning from users and AI agents.
5. **Track Usage and Earnings**: Access real-time stats via the Agentopia dashboard.

## Example: Connecting Your API to Agentopia

Here's a simple example of an API endpoint that charges users $0.000001 (1 micro USDC) per request using Agentopia's SDK:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from agentopia import payable

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello_world")
@payable(
    hold_amount=100000, hold_expires_in=3600
)  # Hold $0.1 in the user's account for 1 hour
async def hello_world(
    request: Request,
):
    print("Executing hello_world endpoint")
    # Execute the service and charge the user $0.000_001
    print("Preparing response with $0.000001 charge")
    response = JSONResponse(
        content={"message": "Hello from Agentopia!"}, headers={"X-Usdc-Used": "1"}
    )
    print("Returning response")
    return response
```

## What's Happening in the Example?

- **Hold Amount**: The `@payable` decorator specifies a hold of $0.10 (100,000 micro USDC) in the user's wallet for 1 hour.
- **Charge**: Once the endpoint is executed, the service deducts $0.000001 from the user's account.
- **Response**: The `X-Usdc-Used` header in the response confirms the amount charged for the service.

## Benefits of Agentopia Integration

- **Automated Payments**: Agentopia handles the payment process, including holds, deductions, and refunds if needed.
- **Secure Transactions**: Built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and trust.
- **Customizable Pricing**: You define the hold amount and charges for each endpoint, giving you full control over monetization.
- **Developer Dashboard**: Monitor service usage, track earnings, and update configurations through an intuitive dashboard.
